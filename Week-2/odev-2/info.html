        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born in Geneva in 1712. He lost his mother shortly after birth and had a difficult childhood. At the age of 16, he left Geneva and began traveling, which exposed him to different ways of life and thought. These experiences would later inform his critical views on society.

        <h3>Philosophical Ideas</h3>
        <p>
            Rousseau is best known for his thoughts on the social contract, personal freedom, and education. He believed that human beings were inherently good but were corrupted by the influence of society and institutions. His famous statement "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains" reflects his views on the constraints imposed by modern civilization.

            As part of the Enlightenment, Rousseau contributed to the rise of democratic thought. He criticized inequality, private property, and hierarchical power. His writings challenged the prevailing ideologies of his time and inspired future revolutions, most notably the French Revolution.

        <h3>Legacy</h3>

            Rousseau's influence extends beyond philosophy into politics, literature, and education. His autobiographical work, <em>Confessions</em>, introduced new levels of personal reflection in literature. His educational theories, presented in <em>Emile</em>, continue to influence modern pedagogy.
